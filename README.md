# SJSU Study Group

This project focuses on building a full-stack web application to connect SJSU students for study groups and academic collaboration. The front-end is being developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with React.js powering dynamic and responsive functionality. Firebase will be integrated to handle user authentication, database management, and real-time updates.

Key features include real-time messaging, course-based group creation, availability sharing, and a user-friendly interface to promote seamless collaboration among students. The beta release is planned for January 2025, with ongoing work to ensure a reliable and engaging experience for all users.
